## Problem Title
 Healthcare & Well-being
## Problem Description


Healthcare and well-being are essential aspects of human life, encompassing the physical, mental, and social dimensions of health. Healthcare refers to the organized provision of medical services aimed at diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases and injuries. It includes primary care, which focuses on routine check-ups, vaccinations, and general health maintenance; secondary care, which involves specialized treatments like cardiology and dermatology; and tertiary care, which provides advanced medical interventions such as organ transplants and cancer treatment. Public health initiatives, including disease control programs, sanitation improvements, and health education, play a crucial role in promoting healthcare at the community level. Additionally, mental health services, including therapy and psychiatric care, are integral to overall well-being, ensuring emotional and psychological stability. A well-functioning healthcare system, whether public, private, or a mix of both, is fundamental in improving life expectancy, reducing disease burdens, and enhancing quality of life.
